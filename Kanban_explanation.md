# Kanban Board Explanation for Meal Planner Project

## What is a Kanban Board?

A Kanban board is an Agile project management visualization tool that provides a dynamic, real-time view of work progress, enabling teams to optimize workflow, identify bottlenecks, and enhance overall productivity. Unlike traditional project management approaches, Kanban focuses on continuous delivery and adaptive planning.

## Workflow Visualization

### Column Structure and Purpose
1. **Backlog**: 
   - Serves as the project's idea reservoir
   - Contains all potential user stories and features
   - Allows for strategic prioritization
   - Provides a comprehensive view of future work

2. **To Do**:
   - Represents committed work for the current sprint
   - Clearly defines immediate priorities
   - Enables team focus and alignment
   - Acts as a staging area for development

3. **In Progress**:
   - Active development zone
   - Shows current work being implemented
   - Provides transparency on ongoing tasks
   - Helps track individual and team productivity

4. **Code Review**:
   - Quality assurance checkpoint
   - Ensures code meets team standards
   - Facilitates knowledge sharing
   - Catches potential issues before testing

5. **Testing**:
   - Comprehensive validation stage
   - Identifies and logs potential defects
   - Ensures functional requirements are met
   - Validates user story acceptance criteria

6. **Done**:
   - Represents completed and verified work
   - Provides a sense of accomplishment
   - Tracks project progress
   - Serves as historical reference

## Work-in-Progress (WIP) Limitations

### Why Limit WIP?
- Prevents team overload
- Reduces context switching
- Improves focus and efficiency
- Identifies and resolves bottlenecks quickly

### Recommended WIP Limits
- Backlog: Unlimited (strategic planning)
- To Do: 5-7 user stories
- In Progress: 3-4 active tasks
- Code Review: 2-3 concurrent reviews
- Testing: 2-3 items being validated
- Done: Unlimited (completed work tracking)

## Live example

*My Kanban board for the Meal Planner project serves as a living, breathing representation of my development journey. By limiting work-in-progress to 3-4 tasks per active column, I ensure focused, high-quality delivery. The board transforms abstract work items into a tangible, manageable workflow, enabling my team to adapt quickly, maintain high standards, and continuously deliver value to our users.*

## Continuous Refinement

- Weekly board review
- Adjust WIP limits as needed
- Encourage team feedback
- Evolve board configuration
