# Reflection: Challenges in Balancing Stakeholder Needs

 ## Balancing the needs of various parties presented several challenges:

 1. **Conflicting Priorities** 
- Users want a simple and intuitive user interface, while engineers prioritize powerful functionality, which can lead to increased system complexity.

 2. **Security vs. Usability** 
- The Compliance Officer required tight security measures, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), which may frustrate consumers who desired a seamless login experience.

 3. **Scalability vs. Performance** 
- The system needed to accommodate 1,000+ concurrent users, requiring large server resources. However, the Business Owner preferred cost-effective deployment options.

 4. **Regulatory Compliance vs. Innovation** 
- Complying with GDPR and dietary standards hindered our ability to deliver personalized services without extensive legal evaluations.

4. **Timelines vs. Feature Completeness**
   - Developers struggled with implementing all requested features within project deadlines while ensuring stability.

### How We Addressed These Challenges:
1. **Prioritization Framework** -We used MoSCoW (Must-have, Should-have, Could-have, Wonâ€™t-have) to manage feature development.
2. **User Testing & Feedback** - Conducted early usability testing to refine the UI while maintaining security standards.
3. **Incremental Updates** -Adopted Agile to allow for continuous improvement based on stakeholder feedback.

***These strategies helped align stakeholder needs with project feasibility while maintaining system quality and usability.***
