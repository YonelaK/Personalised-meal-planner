# Reflection: Challenges in Balancing Stakeholder Needs

 ## Balancing the needs of various parties presented several challenges:

 1. **Conflicting Priorities** 
- Users want a simple and intuitive user interface, while engineers prioritize powerful functionality, which can lead to increased system complexity.

 2. **Security vs. Usability** 
- The Compliance Officer required tight security measures, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), which may frustrate consumers who desired a seamless login experience.

 3. **Scalability vs. Performance** 
- The system needed to accommodate 1,000+ concurrent users, requiring large server resources. However, the Business Owner preferred cost-effective deployment options.

 4. **Regulatory Compliance vs. Innovation** 
- Complying with GDPR and dietary standards hindered our ability to deliver personalized services without extensive legal evaluations.

4. **Timelines vs. Feature Completeness**
   - Developers struggled with implementing all requested features within project deadlines while ensuring stability.

### How We Addressed These Challenges:
1. **Prioritization Framework** -We used MoSCoW (Must-have, Should-have, Could-have, Wonâ€™t-have) to manage feature development.
2. **User Testing & Feedback** - Conducted early usability testing to refine the UI while maintaining security standards.
3. **Incremental Updates** -Adopted Agile for continuous improvement based on stakeholder feedback.

### Assignment 6 Reflections

During this sprint, I faced challenges in setting up the project board, particularly with adding labels and milestones. This process took a significant amount of time, which impacted my overall workflow. Additionally, I encountered an issue where my sprint backlog seemed to be linked to the product backlog, causing tasks to appear in both places when moved.

To resolve this, I decided to start over and create a new project from scratch. This approach helped me organize the backlog properly and ensure that tasks were correctly placed in their respective categories. Through this experience, I learned the importance of carefully structuring the project board from the beginning to avoid unnecessary rework.

Going forward, I will focus on improving my familiarity with project management tools to streamline backlog management and sprint planning. This will help me allocate more time to actual development and testing instead of troubleshooting setup issues.
