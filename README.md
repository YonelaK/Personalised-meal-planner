## Project Kanban Board Configuration

### Workflow Customization
Our Kanban board extends the standard Iterative Development template to include:
- **Requirements Validation**: Ensures user stories meet acceptance criteria
- **Deployment Staging**: Provides environment-specific testing and verification

### Column Purpose
1. **Backlog**: Unprocessed user stories and tasks
2. **Sprint Planning**: Stories selected for upcoming sprint
3. **Requirements Validation**: Verify story details and acceptance criteria
4. **Development**: Active implementation of user stories
5. **Code Review**: Peer review and quality assurance
6. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing phase
7. **Deployment Staging**: Pre-production verification
8. **Done**: Completed and deployed stories

### Labeling Strategy
- `epic`: Large, complex user stories
- `feature`: New functionality additions
- `bug`: Identified defects
- `enhancement`: Improvements to existing features
- `documentation`: Documentation-related tasks
- `high-priority`: Critical items requiring immediate attention

### Workflow Rules
- All stories must pass Requirements Validation
- Minimum of one peer review required
- Deployment Staging mandatory before marking as Done
